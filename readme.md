# Interactive Fourier Transformation

This website allows you to draw on a canvas and visualize the magnitude spectrum using Fourier transformation. You can see the transformed image and compare it to the original drawing.

## About

This project provides an interactive interface to draw on a canvas and apply a 2D Fourier transformation to the drawn image. It uses JavaScript, Python, and various libraries to perform the transformation and display the results.

## Features

- Draw on the canvas and see the live preview of the magnitude spectrum
- Compare the transformed image with the original drawing
- Perform inverse Fourier transformation to obtain the grayscale image
- Adjust the size and resolution of the canvas


## Usage

1. Open the website in your browser
2. Click and drag on the canvas to draw your desired shape
3. The magnitude spectrum of the drawn image will be displayed in real-time
4. Adjust the canvas size and resolution to see the effects on the transformation
5. Click the "Apply Transformation" button to see the transformed image
6. Use the "Show Original" button to toggle between the original drawing and the transformed image
7. Experiment with different drawings and canvas settings to explore the Fourier transformation
